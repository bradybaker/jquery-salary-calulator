# Monthly Salary Expenditure Calculator


## Description

Duration: 16 hours

This app is a monthly salary expenditure calculator (MSEC). The MSEC will take in an employee's company specific information and annual salary, display the information on a table, then calculate the monthly cost of paying that employee. The MSEC will keep a running total of monthly cost for each employee that is entered. It will also keep a running total of the number employees that are entered into the table. If an employee needs to be removed you can press the 'Delete' button at the end of the specific employee's row. The employee's information will be removed from both running totals.
